### MemeX's 『P(A)』

P(A) #1-#100 is a collection of 100 randomly generated images, and each set of works is released as a separate NFT. Unlike most individual artists or galleries that use the NFT marketplace as a way to trade artwork online, the P(A) project is actually "art on the blockchain"; using TokenID as a record of unique identifiers on the chain, the P(A) project deploys a contract with TokenID as a unique identifier. A record of the TokenID as a unique identifier on the chain and the algorithm associated with the TokenID is deployed within the contract to generate the artwork.

### Wormhole Studio's 『Red Packet』
