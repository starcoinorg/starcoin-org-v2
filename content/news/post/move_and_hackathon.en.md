Starcoin officially launched its main network on May 18, 2021. With the rapid development of the ecosystem, Starcoin will fully open its Move contract publishing permission for all users. As the first permissionless Move blockchain, while inheriting the security of Satoshi Nakamoto's consensus, Starcoin enhances the security of Dapps, allowing all developers to write safer smart contracts quickly.

To facilitate developers to write Move contracts and further lower the development and usage barriers, Starcoin has recently released some important updates.

 1. Release a Move contract development tool, Move-cli.
 2. Upgrade the on-chain authentication strategy to simplify the account creation process.
 3. Optimization of the treasury withdrawal mechanism.

In corresponding to the above updates, Starcoin released its first upgrade since the mainnet, which went online on June 8, 2021. This upgrade wholly followed the on-chain governance process through a voting process that took seven days. With the community's joint efforts, the proposal finally had 7088587.7104 STC votes in favor and 2 STC votes against it, and the upgrade deployed successfully on June 15, 2021. Furthermore, with development tools such as Move-cli, contract developers can write and deploy Move contracts quickly across Starcoin's multiple networks (Dev, Test, Hally, Proxima, Barnard, Main, etc.).

With the growing demand for Move deployment in the Starcoin ecosystem, Starcoin plans to launch a new proposal to enable Move contracts officially. The proposal will start voting on June 23, 2021, and end on June 30, 2021, with the initiative to fully allow the deployment of Move contracts, allowing anyone to deploy Move contracts to the chain and create DeFi applications. The passing of this proposal will be a milestone moment, meaning that the Starcoin ecosystem will fully embrace the DeFi ecosystem with open arms.

At the same time, Starcoin announced the launch of a series of new plans and schedules.

## I. The first Starcoin Move Hackathon

The contest will start on June 23rd, 2021, and last until July 31st, 2021(GMT+8). Participants should deploy their contracts before the end time. The hackathon committee will decide the winners. Projects in the following area are encouraged (including, but not limited to)

 - Yield farming
 - DEX
 - Asset-Management
 - Lending
 - NFT
 - Oracle
 - Cross-Chain
 - Algorithmic-Stablecoin

 Further information for the hackathon will be published soon.

## II. A rich Move developer ecosystem support

 To help develop and deploy contracts, Starcoin has upgraded the developer ecosystem as follows.

 1. The new Starcoin website and developer documentation
 2. New Move-cli tool with unit testing functionality
 3. Move 1.2 new feature in Move Book (as well as Chinese version)
 4. Starmask wallet extension with Dapp support
 5. New version of Starcoin block explorer

 During the hackathon, there are several online Move development tutorials available for free. The tutorials will cover the following topics(The time is GMT+8).

 1. Move development, live stream: June 30, 2021
 2. Move Advanced development, live stream: July 7, 2021
 3. Move development in action, live stream: July 14, 2021
 4. Move & DeFi, live stream: July 21, 2021

 In addition, Starcoin will propose an Oracle protocol, and it is the cornerstone of blockchain applications and one of the core infrastructures in the Web 3.0 and DeFi era. The protocol will complete the ecological closure and may even play a decisive role in the development pattern of the industry.

## III. The first DApp of Starcoin - Vote System

 On July 1, 2021, Starcoin will launch its first Dapp, the voting Dapp; it integrates with Starmask -- the Starcoin chrome extension wallet. Users can vote easily on the web page, and very convenient to operate.

 Since its launch, Starcoin has been committed to DeFi infrastructure and actively promoting the application development. We believe that the improved ecology will produce a scale effect and further promote ecological and Starcoin industrial forward.
