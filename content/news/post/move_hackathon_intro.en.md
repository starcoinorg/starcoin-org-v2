Some highlights for the Starcoin Move language:

* Easy to learn
* Flexibility
* An linear logic language that distinguishes between data and resources, making digital assets more secure
* Mathematical method proving the correctness of the system through formal verification

To take full advantage of the Move language, Starcoin activated the Move smart contract publishing feature and launched the first Starcoin Move online hackathon.
